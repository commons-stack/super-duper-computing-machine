  During the initialization phase, we lay the groundwork for the deployment
  project. There are three main modules: kickoff, work agreements and reward
  system & DAO.

# Phase 1: Initialization

<details>

<summary>Module 1: Kickoff</summary>

Checklist for this module:

* [ ] Identify the stakeholders for the Commons
* [ ] Get everyone in a room together
* [ ] Align on goals about the Commons

Congratulations! This is where you will take the very first step to deploying a Commons. This is where participants come together to talk about goals, review the deployment process and reach agreements on working together.

_Here is the most important part of this module: identify the stakeholders for the Commons and anyone that will want to participate and get everyone in a room together!_

The Agenda could look something like this:&#x20;

* Introductions! Who is who and what role they will likely play in the Commons.&#x20;
* Talk about everyone goals for launching a Commons. We recommend using a Miro board to allow everyone time to think and write their answers down to go back to later.
* Review the [Commons Deployment Manual](./).
* Set expectations about timing (take into account vacations, holidays, other commitments, etc).
* Set date for the the next session.

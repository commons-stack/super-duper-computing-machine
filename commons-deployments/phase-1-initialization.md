# Phase 1: Initialization

<details>

<summary>Module 1: Kickoff</summary>

Checklist for this module:

* [ ] Checklist1
* [ ] Checklist2
* [ ] Checklist3

Congratulations! This is where you will take the very first step to deploying a Commons. This is where participants come together to talk about goals, review the deployment process and reach agreements on working together.

Here is the most important part of this module: get everyone in a room together! Identify the stakeholders for the Commons deployment. Invite all participants to a kickoff meeting.

The Agenda could look something like this:&#x20;

* Introductions! Who is who and what role they will likely play in the Commons&#x20;
* Talk about everyone goals for launching a Commons. We recommend using a Miro board to allow everyone time to think and write their answers down to go back to later.
* Review the [Commons Deployment Manual ](./)
* Set expectations about timing (take into account vacations, holidays, other commitments, etc)&#x20;
* Set date for the the next session

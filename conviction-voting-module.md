If you would like to do a deep dive into the details of the math behind Conviction Voting, we have implementation documentation from our ethParis Hackathon submission [https://hackmd.io/@EtCgawsxS2mC6-Q0rCqhAw/rJMvfgOv4?type=view](https://hackmd.io/@EtCgawsxS2mC6-Q0rCqhAw/rJMvfgOv4?type=view)

There are some further implimentations being made by 1Hive on Aragon as well... Very Exciting!!!

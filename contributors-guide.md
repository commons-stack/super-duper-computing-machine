## Commons Stack Praise and CSTK tokens

**The voices and contributions from the Commons Stack community fuel our project and we seek to reflect that contribution to our system.**

One way of doing this is awarding Praise which, at the end of each month turn into [CSTK tokens].

### What are CSTK tokens?
CSTK token are a badge of honor signifying you are trusted. These tokens indicate reputation in the Commons Stack and inclusion in our [**Trusted Seed**](https://medium.com/giveth/the-trusted-seed-of-the-commons-stack-5af6fb04cd30). Later CSTK token will give access to the [launch of future Commons](https://medium.com/giveth/the-commons-stack-scaling-the-commons-to-re-prioritize-people-and-the-planet-fdc076aec4eb).

CSTK tokens are non-transferrable and will never have a monetary value.

#### Add CSTK Tokens in MetaMask

1) Add the xDAI network to metamask https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup
2) Add the CSTK token: Add CSTK as a custom token on MetaMask, the address is 0xc4fbE68522ba81a28879763C3eE33e08b13c499E

If you donâ€™t remember what Ethereum address you used in your application to the Trusted Seed, feel free to DM anyone on the Commons Stack team on Telegram and we can check.

#### Receive CSTK Token, The Praise Lifecycle

You need to [apply for membership](http://commonsstack.org/apply) to receive CSTK tokens. Without this crucial step, Praise cannot be converted into CSTK tokens.

1) Praise is dished in the [Commons Stack discord #praise channel](https://discord.gg/deuSm9nv).
2) If you are dished Praise, the bot will mention you in the main channel - click on its invitation to direct message, and the bot will start a chat with you.
3) The bot will first invite you to apply for membership if you didn't. If you have already applied, you can ignore this.
4) Praise dishing is done on a monthly cycle. Before the 15th of every month the Commons Stack Association will analyze the Praise awarded from the month before and give CSTK tokens to denote the reputation earned in the Trusted Seed.

You can find the live sheet of the awarded Praise throughout a month and the historical record of all awarded Praise and related CSTK tokens [in this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qxgjg4YxTBNIIwIEm3WGDcmGs_8Klv-UzztQCzYLvNA/edit?usp=sharing). You can also see this record by typing "!sheet" in any telegram room the Praisebot \(@PraiseBot\) is in.


#### Future Devloppeemnt
* We hope one day to integrate [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/), as it is a very promising protocol that can serve the same purpose as our PraiseBot, but to keep overhead low, we decided to keep it simply to Praise for now. You can find the source code for our PraiseBot [here](https://github.com/commons-stack/CommonsStackBot).

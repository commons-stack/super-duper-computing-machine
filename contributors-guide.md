## What is Commons Stack Praise?

**The voices and contributions from the Commons Stack community are beyond valuable - and as such we seek to reflect that value within our system. One way of doing this is awarding Praise which, at the end of each month, can turn into CSTK tokens: they indicate reputation in the Commons Stack as well as invite someone to the** [**Trusted Seed**](https://medium.com/giveth/the-trusted-seed-of-the-commons-stack-5af6fb04cd30)**.**

* **Praise is dished in the main** [**Commons Stack telegram channel**](https://t.me/CommonsStack)**.**
* **Praise dishing for the month is closed off at midnight CEST on the last day of each month. Very shortly after this date the dishers convene and discuss the Praise they awarded to each contributor and why. Dishers can make changes to the Praise they awarded up to this date.**
* **After discussion, the representatives assign ‘weight’ to the Praise for that month, which is translated into percentages and recalibrates the final amount of CSTK tokens that is claimable by each contributor.**
* **CSTK tokens are reputation in the Commons Stack. They are non transferrable and will never have monetary value. Rather, they are a badge of membership signifying you are trusted - which gives you the opportunity to take part in the launching of commons.** 
* **If you are dished Praise, the bot will mention you in the main channel - click on its invitation to direct message, and the bot will start a chat with you.
